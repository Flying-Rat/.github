## Hello from Flying Rat 🐀👋

We are a young and passionate team of game developers with extensive experience in the gaming industry. Our experience covers technologies like **Unity**, **Unreal** and custom engines (C++, C#, Rust, ...) on many platforms including **Xbox**, **PlayStation** and **Switch**.
The goal is to make your project **fly**!

We also want to express our creativity - we are working on an internal game codenamed **Project Cheese 🧀**.

We believe in open education and sharing, so last but not least our goal is to open source some internal tools and technologies on this Github organization, so stay tuned!
